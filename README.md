This is the repository for the scripts used in Godino, A. & Junquera, Á.
F. (2025). Outsourcing and time-related dimensions of job quality:
Evidence from the Facility Management business. In F. P. García Márquez,
B. Lev, & H. Liao (Eds.), *Outsourcing. Cases and Studies in Using

The scripts are in the `src` folder and the microdata used for the
analyses can be downloaded from the webpage of the Instituto Nacional de
Estadística ([INE](https://www.ine.es/prodyser/microdatos.htm)).

To ensure reproducibility, we use the `renv` package. Just place all the
files of this repository in your R working directory and run the
following chunk of code. It will install the versions of the packages
that we used to obtain our results.

``` r
# Install {renv} if not yet installed
install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()
```
